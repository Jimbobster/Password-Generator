# Password-Generator

## Description
I was required to create an application that an employee can use, to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected, by modifying starter code. 

This app will run in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes

## Installation
When the Generate Password button is clicked, then you will be presented with a series of prompts for:  

<li>Password criteria</li>
<li>Length of password</li>
<li>If you'd like At least 8 characters but no more than 128</li>
<li>Lowercase</li>
<li>Uppercase</li>
<li>Numeric</li>
<li>Special characters ($@%&*, etc)</li>


The code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once prompts are answered, then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert, or written to the page
